globalPHR
=========

A basic personal health record for humans

GlobalPHR is a medical data exchange format that quickly and reliably allows care providers to access patient information. Unlike competing solutions that are either tethered to the web, very low capacity, or unaffordable, GlobalPHR stores a broad set of essential data in an easy to use, portable, and affordable offline format.
